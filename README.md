> Ecoqo - Future through Community

## Build Setup

To start the project, open MAIN HOMEPAGE STATIC, and open index.html



Ecoqo - Future through Community

1. One-liner: Direct pipeline between volunteers & organizations (charities, bigger influencers)

2. The idea of Ecoqo is to offer a way for people within different communities, to interact with each other while doing environmental activities, charity & volunteer work. 

- Your company needs some team building to strenghten company culture ? Join an event, make a social impact, and interact

- You've watched that kid on TV about social awareness, and want to give it a try? Come to Ecoqoa and find an event near you!


3. The Technology

We created a Java Server, that will handle various requests (JSON), such as functions for various systems on the app (ex. Ranking system for volunteers based on contribution). 

We used Vue.JS to run the frontend of the application, for parts that have functionality. Bootstrap for the design, as well as vanilla Javascript.
